  <section id="aboutMe">
    <p>Hi there!  My name is Chris Ledford and I am very excited about my journey into the world of coding and web development!  So far most of my knowledge is self taught, but I am currently enrolled and active in a program teaching the skills I will require to ensure success in the future.  I have experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as some PHP and SQL knowledge.  I currently reside in Lafayette, Colorado which is just outside Boulder and a short(ish) commute to the Denver Metro area.  I currently work for Sprouts as a Scan Coordinator, and just started my 8th year of employment there.  I am responsible for making sure all the prices are correct and that everything rings up correctly at the register.</p>
      
    <p>I have always liked and been drawn to computers and I have built every desktop I have ever owned, with the exception of my first one which was built by my father.  My father has worked in the industry for many years and has been instrumental in pushing me and allowing me to finally pursue something I love.</p>

    <p>In my free time I like to collect coins, play disc golf, and do just about anything with my wife, daughter and our dogs.</p>
